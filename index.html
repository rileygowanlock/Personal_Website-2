                        <p>I was 10 when I was first introduced to the world of programming. My older brother took a computer science course at his high school. He showed me his implementation of the Shell Game, in which the player must guess under which of 3 shells a marble is hidden.</p>

                        <p>I was amazed.</p>

                        <p>And I remember thinking to myself, I want to learn how to do this.</p>

                        <p>I first started programming in high school. I took two computer science courses, where I was taught to program using Python. My most notable projects included Duck Hunt, Pacman, and Tetris, which I created utilizing the Pygame framework. I received both the Grade 11 and Grade 12 computer science awards.</p>

                        <p>Realizing my passion for programming, I applied to Software Engineering at the University of Waterloo. To my excitement, I was accepted into the program.</p>

                        <p>I was introduced to C and C++ in my first year computer science courses. For a second year course, I successfully implemented a compiler using C++.</p>

                        <p>For my first co-op term, I worked in Ottawa at Gemalto as a software engineer. I developed a web-based client, and gained experience using HTML, CSS and Javascript with JQuery. I also had the opportunity to improve my Python skills, working on a python GUI as well automating test coverage using the pytest framework.</p>
                        
                        <p>Currently I am in Vancouver, completing my second work term at Coho Data as a fullstack developer.</p>
